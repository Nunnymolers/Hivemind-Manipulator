			<h1>Who We Are</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Hivemind Manipulator is a company that seeks to build drones for the distribution industry to optimize shipping and improve the overall customer experience. Our product is a drone that distributes products for the community, and is partnered with many of the public’s transporting companies. Just like a trucking company, we bring products to people, but a drone is carrying the package instead of a human driving a truck. Our alternative is much better than trucking or planes because we don’t use fuel and don’t pollute the air. Also, our drones will never have to be stuck in traffic, so the packages will be at the customers house much faster. We have just passed $200,000 in sales and are projected to hit $2.3 million in sales by 2020.
