			<h1>Calling all Investors</h1>
			<p>
				To whom it may concern, <br> <br>
            We are Hivemind Manipulator, a drone company that has been at the forefront of drone innovation since 1969. To refresh your memory, we gave a speech at XCon announcing our new drone sky-port. We have most of the money but we are requesting a 50,000 dollar loan in exchange for 5% equity from investors. The money you donate to us will be spent on the production of drones and the sky port. If you have any questions, please contact us.
            <br> <br>
Sincerely, <br> Hivemind Manipulator
