				Some ways that we can outreach to people are to advertise, meet with them, conduct surveys, and host fundraisers. We can also put out advertisements on Youtube and we can put it on billboards. We can meet with other companies to figure out what the people want and how we can improve our company. We can survey people to also figure out what they think is bad about our company. To conduct this survey, we can link it in our website or add it to our advertisements on youtube.
