			<h1>Our Goals</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Hivemind Manipulator plans to both expand and be environmentally friendly in the future. Our vision is to see our first wave of drones released by September this year. These drones have already been prototyped and tested so that they will be able to perform up to standard 100% of the time when production starts. This standard requires all of our drones to fly long distances with packages of up to 30 kilograms, fly successfully at least 98% of the time, fly with speeds up to 60 miles per hour, and recharge on the go using entirely solar power. We also plan to create a drone network spanning the whole of the United States. This goal is achievable and in sight, as we are already producing drones of this standard in our factories. 
				<br>Some of our goals in the future is to also see this drone network set up in countries in Asia and the UK. We also plan to reach out and partner with large transportation and delivery companies such as Amazon and FedEx in order to increase our profits worldwide.
				<br>We also plan to have at least 30,000 people employed by Hivemind Manipulator, and to be at the very forefront of worker life quality and efficiency. Our vision is to have every employee at our company be cared and provided for, as they are caring and providing for our company.
				<br>2018 is the year in which we plan to broaden our horizons. We plan to make 1,000,000 dollars in profit by the end of this fortuitous year. In order to keep up with the current climate and our promise of going green, we also promise to decrease our current carbon emissions by 70% by the end of this year. These factories should also be entirely automated (with the exception of human supervisors) by 2019. 
				<br>Hivemind Manipulator is also dedicated to constant improvement, which is why we plan to release a second wave of drones in the next year. These drones will be able to fly long distances with packages with weights up to 200 kilograms, fly successfully 100% of the time, and fly with speeds up to 100 miles per hour. These drones will also be able to recharge on the go using both improved solar technology and wind power. The second wave of drones are currently in development and production.
				<br>Here at Hivemind Manipulator, we believe that all of our goals are 100% attainable due to our sustainability, worker treatment, and innovative technologies. Join us in expanding the new, drone horizons.
